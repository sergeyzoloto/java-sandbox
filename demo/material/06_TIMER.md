# TimerTask

`TimerTask` is a task that can be scheduled for one-time or repeated execution by a Timer. It is an abstract class that implements the Runnable interface, requiring the implementation of the `run` method where the task's code resides. TimerTasks are useful for scheduling tasks that need to be executed periodically or at a specific time, such as reminders or routine data updates.
