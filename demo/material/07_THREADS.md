# Threading in Java

## Threads

Threads in Java are the smallest unit of execution within a process. Java provides the `Thread` class and the `Runnable` interface to create and manage threads, allowing multiple threads to run concurrently. This concurrency model enables the development of highly responsive and interactive applications by performing time-consuming operations in the background, improving application performance.

## Multithreading, Runnable

Multithreading refers to the concurrent execution of two or more threads within a program, allowing multiple operations to run simultaneously, improving the application's responsiveness and performance. The `Runnable` interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread, defining a single method `run`, where the action of the thread is specified.
