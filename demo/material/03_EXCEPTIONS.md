# Exception handling

Exception handling allows a program to deal with runtime errors in a graceful manner. It is achieved through the use of `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks. The try block contains the code that might throw an exception, while the catch block is used to handle the exception. The finally block contains code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not. This ensures that necessary cleanup can be performed, such as closing file streams or releasing resources.
